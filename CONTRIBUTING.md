# How to Contribute

I am happy to receive contributions -- there are certainly places where existing functionality can be improved or extended, or room for new functionality.

The ideal mode for contributing is through pull requests.
If possible adhere to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit message styling.

Apart from the rest, it's expected to behave appropriately.

## Coding Conventions

* Use ruff for linting and formatting/
* That's really it. Ruff handles it.
